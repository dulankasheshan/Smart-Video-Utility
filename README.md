# Smart Video Utility 🚀

A lightweight browser extension designed to enhance and streamline the video playback experience on YouTube.

## Disclaimer ⚠️

- This extension is NOT intended to bypass or violate any terms of service.
- Use this tool at your own risk. The developer (LKPixel) is not responsible for any misuse, account issues, or legal implications resulting from the use of this software.

## How it Works
Instead of simply clicking a button, this utility intelligently monitors the video player's state. When an advertisement segment is detected, it instantly **fast-forwards the playback to the final second**, effectively resuming your main content immediately without manual intervention.

## Features
- **High-Speed Teleportation:** Minimizes wait times by jumping to the end of ad segments.
- **Native Interaction:** Uses prototype-level methods to ensure smooth execution.
- **Clean UI:** Simple iOS-style toggle for easy management.
- **Performance Optimized:** Written in vanilla JavaScript for minimal memory footprint.

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions` in your browser.
3. Enable **Developer Mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select this folder.
